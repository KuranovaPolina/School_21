Educational project Pong from organization «School 21».

* ***Task***

Develop an src/pong.c program for a two-player game, 
similar to Pong. To display the graphics, only use ASCII characters (with output 
to the terminal).

* ***Keys***

A/Z and K/M - to move the rackets;

Space Bar - to skip an action at a certain step of the game in step-by-step mode.

* ***Graphics***

The field is a 80 x 25-symbol rectangle.

Racket size is 3 symbols; 

Ball size is 1 symbol.

* ***UI/UX***

When one of the players scores 21 points, congratulations to the winner are displayed on the screen and the game ends.

## Bonus Part:
Quest received. You need to implement interactive version of the PONG (real-time game mode). Additional 
libraries can be used to simplify the processing of the players' actions and displaying symbolic graphics..

## Important notes:

* The game must be written in C, have a structured style, and run from the terminal; 

* It is forbidden to use dynamic memory

* When developing the game, follow 
the principles of structured programming of E. Dijkstra.
